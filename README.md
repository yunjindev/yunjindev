## Hi there 👋

Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am a iOS developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a school and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love to design and build applications for iOS. I mainly build in Swift and Xcode but I am familiar with other langauges like JavaScript, Python, and C# where I use TMUX + NVIM!

I really enjoy game development as well! Most of my 2D projects are created in Godot using GDScript. I also have experience working with Unity in C# and Unreal Engine with visual scripting for 3D projects.

I am currently working on a project called **Kdropworld**!

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
