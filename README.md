## Hi!

I am yunjindev (Hunter) and I am a web developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at school, from IT to web development I love solving problems, creating communities, and building things to make other peoples lives easier.

Current Project: **Lock In! Firefox Extension**

Languages I build in are JavaScript, Go, Swift, C#, and Python.

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Reading (current [book](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Jeong-Building-Connections/dp/1735566799), current [manga](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/blue-box))
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Collecting albums & photocards
