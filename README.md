## Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am a developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a school and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love game development and use Unity and C# for most my projects! I have also worked in Godot 4 and used GDScript and a little but of Unreal Engine with visual scripting.

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
