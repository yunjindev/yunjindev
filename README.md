## Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am a game developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a school and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love developing games for others to play! I use Unity and C#, and I’ve also worked with Godot 4 and GDScript, as well as Unreal Engine and visual scripting.

I use all three major operating systems in my workflow: **macOS Tahoe 26.1 (MacBook M4 Air)**, **Windows 11 Gaming PC**, and **Fedora Linux 43 Laptop** — not for any specific reason, I just enjoy all of them.

C# isn't my only langauge! I have also used Swift for iOS apps, Python for automation tasks, and JavaScript to build web applications

Some other software/tools I use to make games are:
  - Blender
  - Gimp
  - Aseprite
  - Substance Painter 3D
  - TMUX + NVIM
  - VSCode
  - Visual Studio
  - Rider

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
