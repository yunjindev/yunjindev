## Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am a iOS developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a university and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love to design and build applications for iOS. I mainly build in Swift and Xcode but I am familiar with other langauges
like JavaScript, Python, and C#.

I also really enjoy game development, I have experimented with Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine. I always stuck with Unity for most my projects utilizing C# but I do really love using Godot and GDScript.

I am currently working on a project called **Kdropworld**! 

I use a MacBook Air M4, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and an iPad A16

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
