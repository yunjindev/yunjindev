## Hi!

I am yunjindev (Hunter), and I'm currently working on **Kdropworld**.

Languages I build in are JavaScript, Go, Swift, C#, and Python

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Reading (sometimes...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Collecting albums
