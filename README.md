## Hi!!!

My name is Hunter (yunjindev) and I am a game developer from PA. I have a B.S in Cybersecurity and currently work in IT.

Most of my development work is done in C# and Unity but I have experience in Godot using GDScript and Unreal Engine using visual scripting.

Other languages that I am familiar with are Go, Swift, and JavaScript.

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Reading (sometimes...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Collecting albums
