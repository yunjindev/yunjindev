## Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am a iOS developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a university and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love to design and build applications for iOS. I mainly build in Swift and Xcode but I am familiar with other langauges
like JavaScript, Python, and C# where I use TMUX + NVIM! 

I really enjoy game development too! A lot of my 2D projects are done in Godot 4 using GDScript. I have some experience in Unity using C# and Unreal Engine using visual scripting for 3D projects!

I am currently working on a project called **Kdropworld**!

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
