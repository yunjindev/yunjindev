## Hi there 👋

My name is Hunter, I am an game developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a school and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I love developing games for others to play! I use Unity and C#, and I’ve also worked with Godot 4 and GDScript, as well as Unreal Engine and visual scripting.

I use all 3 big operating systems for my development workflow! I have a Macbook M4 Air, Windows 11 Gaming PC, and A Linux Laptop! (None of these are for specific reasons I just like them all)

Other Langauges I am familiar with are:
  - JavaScript
  - Swift
  - Python

Some other software/tools I use to make games are:
  - Blender
  - Gimp
  - Aseprite
  - Substance Painter 3D
  - TMUX + NVIM
  - VSCode
  - Visual Studio

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
