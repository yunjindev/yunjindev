## Hi there 

My name is Hunter, I am a backend developer from PA.

I currently work in IT at a university and I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity.

I have knowledge of Go, Swift, Javascript, C#, and GDScript.

I use Fedora Linux 43 and tmux + nvim

Some of my hobbies outside developing are:
  - Pickleball
  - Competitive video games
  - Korean langauge (although I am out of practice, I have convinced myself I will learn the langauge some day...)
  - Reading (sometimes...)
  - Listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XOEoxLvMXbuDykU5vN1aR?si=453ede0459f54a04)
  - Buidiling & collecting computer peripherals
  - Collecting albums
